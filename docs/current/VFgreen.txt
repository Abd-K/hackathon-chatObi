Vodafone is committed to fully abate for our own operations by 2030, and for our full carbon footprint by 2040.
Our 2030 carbon reduction targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative as in line with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.
By 2030, Vodafone will fully abate all carbon emissions from its own activities and from energy it purchases and uses (Scope 1 and 2). We will also halve carbon emissions from Scope 3 sources, including joint ventures, all supply chain purchases, the use of products it has sold and business travel.
By 2040, Vodafone will have fully abated Scope 3 emissions completely - bringing forward by ten years Vodafone’s original 2050 ambition to reach net zero across our full carbon footprint.
